bookay is a set of free, open-source tools for self-hosting your bookmarks.

- self-hosting your bookmarks offers the best privacy

## Features

- easily deployed [backend](./server/)
- customizable, keyboard-friendly [browser plugin](./plugin/)
- lightweight (~50 kB) [web app](./webapp/)
- support for nested folders
- data import and export
